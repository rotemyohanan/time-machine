Trusted Third party with good encryption.

HTTP - application layer protocol, means it is focuses on how the information is presented to the user.
It does not care about how the data gets from point to point.

It is a stateless (doesn't attempt to remember anything about the previous web session).
pro - less data to send = better speed performances.
HTTP operates on TCP port 80 (by default).

HTTPS (secure HyperText Transfer Protocol) is for practical porpuses HTTP.
Uses TCP port 443 by default.

HTTP and HTTPS are 2 different and seperate communications.

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is used to transport the data safely.
HTTP/HTTPS does not care how the data gets to its destination.
SSL does not care how the data looks like.

HTTPS is secured because it uses SSL to move data.

HTTP job is to present the data to the user.
