// --------------  Grails Web Layers  -------------- //
/*
A controller fulfills the C in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern and is responsible for handling web requests.
In Grails a controller is a class with a name that ends in the convention "Controller" and lives in the grails-app/controllers directory.
Controllers:
    A controller handles requests and creates or prepares the response.
    A controller can generate the response directly or delegate to a view.
    To create a controller, simply create a class whose name ends with Controller in the grails-app/controllers directory



The real purpose of a controller is to deal with routing logic- which means: 
 - Receive requests from users
 - Invoke the most appropriate business logic
 - Invoke the view to display the result

View: logic should be taken care of inside Groovy Server Pages (GSP) files


Controller: It is a servlet which handles all the request from the front end.
In general, Grails servlet extends Springâ€™s DispatcherServlet to bootstrap the Grails environment

/*
Controller actions:
    A controller can have multiple public action methods. each action is mapped to a URI
    The preffered approach is to use method (at the past it was made using closures)
    The benefits are:
    - Memory efficient.
    - Allow using of stateless controllers (singleton scope)
    - override actions
    - Methods can be intercepted with standard proxying mechanisms

    The controller has a default URI that maps to the root URI
    default action:
        - If there is only 1 action - it is the default action.
        - method with the name index() - is the default when there are multiple actions.
        - set the property of the relevant method to default
        static defaultAction = "list"
  
    Scope: hash-like objects where you can store variables.
    
        servletContext - Also known as application scope, this scope lets you share state across the entire web application. 
                         The servletContext is an instance of ServletContext
        session - allows associating state with a given user and typically uses cookies to associate a session with a client. 
                  The session object is an instance of HttpSession
        request - The request object allows the storage of objects for the current request only. 
                  The request object is an instance of HttpServletRequest
        params - Mutable map of incoming request query string or POST parameters

    All the controllers are placed in the dir: "grails-app/controllers/myapp/BookController.groovy"
    Creating a controller:
        1. class name includes Controller in the suffix. example: class SimpleController.
        2. define the package where the controller is defined.

//Controller Example:
package asia.grails.tutorial

class HelloController {
	def index() {              // returns to the browser in the index.gsp.
		render "Hello World"   // render = return result to the browser.
	}
	def hi() {                 // returns to the browser in the hi.gsp.
		render "How are you?"

build.xml - this file builds the project when running it.
Spring provides pre-written servlet calls: Dispatcher Servlet.
Each controller has a plugin to the Dispatcher.

Browser  <--------> Server
Spring DispatcherServlet decides which controller will react to the request
The DispatcherServlet is the web-app.xml file.
<servlet>
    ...
</servlet>

<Servlet-mapping>
    all the url patterns are filled inside here.

Controller -----> calls the relevant ---> Model (Spring service)  // it is done automatically without Application Context.
The Model runs and represents the result in the relevant .gsp page

Usually the controller returns a collection of data (list / map)
The collection is sent to the view and the Spring shows it.
@RequestMApping("/viewAllBooks") - This is a method we wants to connect it by the URL from the Browser.

@Controller - Marks the class as a controller.
Use it before the class signature.

@Autowired - searching for bean of the methodname in the beans file.

@RequestMapping("/viewAllBooks") - before the method
